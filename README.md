# WeatherPy

Here I've created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I've used the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. I used a starter file provided in the Bootcampe materials. 

# VacationPy

Here I've expaned on my weather data skills to plan future vacations. Here I've used the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API to plot cities and desired hotels according to their weather conditions.
